# Creating a social media type application to keep track of activities I'm doing, or will do in the future. These activities can be concerts, tours, trips, cruises, hikes, etc. Using the CQRS pattern to maintain separation of commands and queries since majority of the application is reliant on commands, more so than complex queries. Also will be utilizing signalR to create comments within event pages
